# Why moving my project to scikit-learn-contrib?

* Visibility: be part of a growing ecosystem of scikit-learn compatible projects
* Collaboration: volunteers from around the world can join you in improving the project
* Quality: benefit from scikit-learn's experience in producing high-quality machine learning software
* URL: http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/project-name

# Requirements

* [ ] Available on github
* [ ] scikit-learn compatible ([check_estimator](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.estimator_checks.check_estimator.html) passed)
* [ ] Documentation (guide, API reference, example gallery)
* [ ] Unit tests 
* [ ] Python3 compatible
* [ ] [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant
* [ ] Continuous integration

To satisfy these requirements, the easiest way is to start your project from 
[project-template](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/project-template).

# Workflow

1. File a [request for inclusion](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/scikit-learn-contrib/issues/new)
into scikit-learn-contrib.
2. The project undergoes a simple review by scikit-learn or scikit-learn-contrib members to check
that the above requirements are satisfied.
3. A team is created in the scikit-learn-contrib organization for your project.
4. [Transfer your project](https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-a-repository/) to the scikit-learn-contrib organization.
